## OldFashionPound
A library (package OldFashionPound) implementing the 4 arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication and division) for pre-1970 UK prices. 

Under the old money system of UK, before 1970, there were 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings, or 240 pence, in a pound. Thus, a price in th OldUK Money system was expressed in Pounds, Shillings and Pence. 

For example "12p 6s 10d" is 12 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 10 Pence.


Sum and Subtraction should add or subtract two prices respectively.

Example SUM:                  
* 5p 17s 8d + 3p 4s 10d = 9p 2s 6d

Example SUBTRACTION:               
* 5p 17s 8d - 3p 4s 10d = 2p 12s 10d

Subtractions giving negative results are managed:
* 5p 17s 8d - 5p 18s 8d = 0d (-1s 0d)


Multiplication and division will multiply or divide a price by an integer 

Example MULTIPLICATION:         
* 5p 17s 8d * 2 = 11p 15s 4d

Example DIVISION:
* 5p 17s 8d / 3 = 1p 19s 2d (2p) 

Another Example DIVISION          
* 18p 16s 1d / 15 = 1p 5s 0d (1s 1d)

## PART 2

Implements sequentials arithmetic operations with OldFashionPound

Example SUM:                  
* 1p 1s 1d + 1p 1s 1d + 1p 1s 1d = 3p 3s 3d

## PART 3

Create a command line interface that could read your operation in a specified format and be able to return the correct result

# Usage 

```bash
$ java -jar path/to/OldFashionPound-X.X.X.jar [expression]
```

Expression must follow one of this rule:
* Xp Ys Zd [+|-] Ap Bs Cd
* Xp Ys Zd [*|/] K
